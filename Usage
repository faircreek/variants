If you running a debian type install do a
apt-get install filepp

Other systems get filepp from
http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~dm26/filepp/


Download variants from the git repo

https://github.com/faircreek/variants/archive/master.zip

Unpack in your current working dir and now you can run

filepp -m function.pm -m variants.pm resolv.conf.V_Source
filepp -m function.pm -m variants.pm resolv.conf.V_Source2
do a chmod 755 on filepp.alt
Fix line 60 so you have the right path to filepp std modules
Now you can run 
./filepp.alt -m function.pm -m variants.pm resolv.conf.V_Source3

The alt filepp is using an other default maker than # 
It also modified so you can mark gid,uid and mode in the file
just as in resolv.conf.V_Source3. Most of the code is there
but not all.
